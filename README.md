# NYC Subway Station Locator

These are the resource files needed for the [NYC Subway Station Locator](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/nyc-subway-station-locator/)
code lab from Google.

## Introduction for the [NYC Subway Station Locator codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/nyc-subway-station-locator/)

Store locators are an often required component of any commercial website that wants to encourage users to visit bricks and mortar stores. 
In this codelab you’ll build a website that serves location data, and scales automatically, thanks to the power of Google App Engine. 
We show you how to expose an easily navigable visualization of the NYC subway using Google Maps JavaScript API.

## What you'll build
In this codelab, you'll build a visualization for the NYC Subway Station dataset that is:
* *Scalable* - you’ll use Google App Engine to automatically scale your serving capability to match request load.
* *Maintainable* - you’ll use the Go programming language to make the back end code simple, reliable, and efficient.
* *Customizable* - you’ll style the map using the [styling capability](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/styling) of the Google Maps JavaScript API, with the help of [Google Maps Style Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/).


## What you’ll learn

* How to use [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) services like [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) and [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
* How to serve [GIS data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) on the web easily
* How to style Google Maps


## What you’ll need

* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Golang, and Chrome DevTools
* An [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015) capable web browser, such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), or [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/microsoft-edge).
